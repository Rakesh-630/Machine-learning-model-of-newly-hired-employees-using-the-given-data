# Machine-learning-model-of-newly-hired-employees-using-the-given-data
Develop a machine learning model to predict the salaries of newly hired employees based on the given dataset. The model will analyze key features such as education, experience, job role, skills, and location. Use data preprocessing techniques to clean and encode the data, followed by feature selection to identify impactful variables. Train the model using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest) to establish relationships between features and salaries. Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE or RÂ². This predictive model will enable the company to make data-driven salary decisions for new hires efficiently.
